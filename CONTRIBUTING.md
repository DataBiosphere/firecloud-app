# How to contribute

Thanks for stopping by!

If you are thinking of filing an issue in this repository, please read ... 

This repository is used to track the development workstream for the FireCloud App engineering team. Though the repository is open/public, we ask that issues filed here are limited to the engineering work actually targeted for that team. Here are some guidelines to ensure you land in the right spot.

## If you have a feature request

Please search for, upvote, and submit feature requests in the _Feature Requests_ section of the [FireCloud Forum](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/). Feature requests will regularly be de-duplicated and "graduate" from there into this repository, or into another  microservice's repository if the technical implementation would be performed by another team.

##  If you're not sure if the issue you're seeing is a bug, or you otherwise need support

Please post in the _Ask the FireCloud Team_ section of the [FireCloud Forum](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/). The Forum is actively monitored by a dedicated team and you'll get a much faster response; notifications from this repository are watched much less frequently. Just like feature requests, bugs will regularly be de-duplicated and "graduate" from the forum into here, or into another  more appropriate repository.

## If you are definitely seeing a bug

Ideally, post it in the _Ask the FireCloud Team_ section of the [FireCloud Forum](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/) so others who might run into it can benefit by knowing what you've found. But you're already here in this repo - feel free to file it here instead if that's less friction. We'd much rather know about the bug than have the bug get forgotten because we're asking you to jump around and log in elsewhere.

## If what you're seeing doesn't fall into one of the previous categories

Post in the [FireCloud Forum](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/) if you would like a faster response, but once again feel free to post here instead so the issue doesn't get lost!

Thanks again,
